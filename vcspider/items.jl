At a strategic level hedge fund strategies can be divided into two categories: convergent strategies and divergent strategies.\n\nConvergent strategies focus on overvalued/undervalued situations that seek to perform well in periods of stable or declining volatility while divergent strategies seek to perform well during periods of rising volatility. SSARIS believes that for a portfolio to have the ability to generate consistent absolute returns in any economic environment the portfolio should consist of both types of strategies. Various members of the Executive Management Team of SSARIS have worked together for over 25 years of managing hedge fund strategies. This has only served to reinforce the philosophy of generating absolute returns."], "pageurl": ["http://www.ssaris.com/UI/Firm/philosophy.aspx"], "siteurl": ["ssaris.com"]}

The goal of our plan is that we will continue or resume as quickly as possible critical business operations during these types of disruptions.\n\n\n\nOur plan addresses the actions that we will take in the event that the significant disruption affects a single building a business district a citywide area or an entire region. We have different planned recovery times depending on the severity of the significant business disruption. In most of the scenarios addressed by our plan we anticipate recovery times within 24 hours from the significant business disruption. Even in the most significant business disruption scenario addressed by our plan we anticipate that critical business operations could be resumed within five days.\n\n\n\nTo support our Business Continuity Plan recovery times we maintain a back-up facility including a secondary data center for all of our branches. Our back-up facility is located well away from our primary facilities so that it would not be affected by a regional disruption. Account access would be available through the data center at our back-up facility. Our plan will be reviewed updated and tested periodically. If a material change to the plan occurs this Notice of Business Continuity Preparedness will be updated as appropriate.

{"pagetitle": ["\r\n\t\r\n\tQuant Corner - Risk Exposures in Diversified Multi-Asset Class Portfolios"], "text": ["The Curious Case of Risk Exposures in Diversified Multi-Asset Class Portfolios\n\nBy Jess Gaspar PhD Managing Director Head of Quantitative Research and Suresh Iyer CFA PhD Director Quantitative Research\n\nOur research at Commonfund has found that a 70/30 stock/bond portfolio1 has north of 99 percent of its risk as measured by standard deviation allocated to equities. Thus portfolio risk typically is not broadly diversified across equities and fixed income but rather highly concentrated in one exposure: equities. Does a more diversified portfolio such as a typical endowment portfolio do a better job of balancing risk?\n\nFor our representative diversified portfolio we use the 2014 NACUBO-Commonfund Study of Endowments (NCSE) portfolio. This study includes 832 U.S. educational institutions (public and private) representing $516 billion in assets making it broadly representative of the endowment universe. This diversified NCSE portfolio adds real assets and hedge funds to the traditional domestic focused 70/30 portfolio. The proportions are 51% global equity 13% fixed income 13% real assets and 23% hedge funds.2\n\nExhibit 1 below shows the return and risk statistics for the asset class constituents of the NCSE portfolio. Also illustrated are the correlations of each asset class with the NCSE portfolio. Statistics of the traditional 70/30 portfolio are provided alongside for reference.\n\nFor the diversified NCSE portfolio the dollar allocation to asset classes misrepresents the risk allocation in the portfolio. Relatively similar percentage dollar allocations to Fixed Income (13%) and Real Assets (13%) translate into considerably different percentage risk contributions: less than 1 percent from fixed income and over 18 percent from real assets. Percentage contributions to portfolio risk by asset class can be calculated using the x-sigma-rho framework coined by Jose Menchero and Ben Davis. The drivers of this mismatch are the asset classes\u2019 differences in volatility and correlation with the total portfolio. Fixed income and hedge funds have low levels of volatility (3-7%) compared to equities and real assets (16-18%). Also fixed income has a low correlation with the total portfolio (less than 10%) when compared to equity real assets and hedge funds (80-100%).\n\nCompared to the 70/30 portfolio that has more than 99 percent\u00a0of portfolio risk coming from equities the NCSE portfolio looks better diversified since the contribution from equities is only about 70 percent. However we show below that due to the high correlation among three of the constituent asset classes the NCSE portfolio has equity \u201cfactor\u201d risk well north of 70 percent.\n\nThe relatively high correlation of equity real assets and hedge funds to one another suggests the presence of one or more common underlying \u201cfactor\u201d exposures. Perhaps unsurprisingly the primary common exposure is equity itself but there are other shared exposures. We use a market factor model to identify the key drivers of risk for long term investors from amongst equity duration (interest rate) credit and commodity price risk.5 This parsimonious set of factors captures most of the market risk embedded in typical diversified multi-asset class portfolios. Currency was evaluated as a factor but it did not have statistical significance.\n\nExhibit 2 shows the factor exposures in the NCSE portfolio from the perspective of contributions to risk. The contributions to risk in each row sum to 100 percent. This is as it should be: we are explaining all of the risk in each of the portfolios. Or are we? The last column in Exhibit 2 presents the idiosyncratic contribution to risk - the component of risk that is not explained by the factors we examined. Note that some of the individual asset class idiosyncratic risks look substantial especially real assets and hedge funds. However the asset class idiosyncratic risks diversify one another away. Thus at the portfolio level idiosyncratic risks are small (less than 10%) showing that this four factor model explains most of the factor risk.\n\nReturning to the systematic factor exposures there are a few additional key observations worth making. First equity is evidently a broadly shared risk across asset classes. Equities real assets and hedge funds all exhibit non-negligible contributions from equity risk. Second real assets and hedge funds have the best diversified risk of the four asset classes with multiple factors contributing at least 10 percent. Finally based on the data the NCSE portfolio exhibits better risk balance than the traditional 70/30 portfolio. The addition of hedge funds and real assets to the traditional 70/30 portfolio does improve diversification and reduce risk concentration. Yet the commonality of equity risk across asset classes means that equities still account for more than 85 percent\u00a0of portfolio risk.\n\nWhat is an Institutional Investor to do?\n\nOur analysis finds that historically diversified multi-asset class portfolios diversify risk better than traditional portfolios but still leave the portfolio with about 87 percent\u00a0of its risk exposure in equities. Adding real assets and hedge funds to a traditional 70/30 portfolio reduces equity\u2019s contribution to risk by about 12 percent. This is a valuable step in the right direction even if from a factor exposure perspective these portfolios still remain less diversified than we might wish.\n\nYet hope remains because investors have more levers to pull. They may achieve greater strategic diversification by increasing the role of active management adding additional asset classes directly sourcing factor exposures like carry or low volatility and by judiciously employing risk parity-style strategies.6 In addition investors may pursue tactical diversification by rebalancing risk exposures over time. This form of dynamic asset allocation involves reducing exposures to asset classes with rising volatility and increasing exposure to asset classes with falling volatility.\n\nReaders interested in further details on this topic will find more information in our upcoming paper The Curious Case of Risk Exposures in Portfolios to be published later this year.\n\n2 The average NCSE portfolio allocations across all responding institutions are as follows: Equities 51% (15.7% US Large Cap 1.3% US Small Cap 12.2% Developed International 6.8% Emerging markets 11% Private Equity 4% Venture Capital); Fixed Income 13% (6.7% Core Bonds 2.3% Global Bonds 4% short-term securities); Real Assets 13% (6% Private Real Estate 6% Private Natural Resources 1% Commodities); Hedge Funds 23% (12.6% Directional Hedge 8.4% Relative Value 2% Distressed Debt).\n\n3\u00a0Jose Menchero Ben Davis (2011). Risk Contribution is Exposure Time Volatility Times Correlation: Decomposing Risk Using the X-Sigma-Rho Formula. The Journal of Portfolio Management Vol. 37 No.2: pp. 97-106\n\n4\u00a0Equity risk is represented by the MSCI ACWI equity total return index net of 3 month U.S. Treasury bills duration risk by the Bank of America Merrill Lynch US 7-10yr Treasury note total return index net of 3 month U.S. Treasury bills credit risk by the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond excluding U.S. Treasuries excess return index and commodity risk by the S&P GSCI Spot Commodities index net of 3 month U.S. Treasury bills\n\n5\u00a0Risk parity involves the application of leverage to increase the contribution from factor exposures like duration and credit that exhibit attractive diversification properties but provide low contributions to risk in typical multi-asset class portfolios.\n\nInformation opinions or commentary concerning the financial markets economic conditions or other topical subject matter are prepared written or created prior to printing and do not reflect current up-to-date market or economic conditions.

Summit Partners and AlpInvest Partners Inc. Based in Atlanta Georgia LogistiCare is the nation's largest case management provider coordinating non-emergency transportation (NET) services primarily to Medicaid recipients. The acquisition is effective December 7 2007.\n\nThe acquisition had a purchase price of approximately $220 million consisting primarily of cash with approximately $13.2 million in LogistiCare employee stock options that are being cancelled and exchanged into Providence Service Corporation common stock. In addition Providence may make an earn out payment of up to $40 million in 2009 based on LogistiCare's financial performance for the fiscal year December 31 2008.\n\nThe acquisition was facilitated through $213 million in senior secured facilities comprised of a $173 million senior term loan and a $40 million revolving line of credit that closed on December 7 2007. CIT Capital Securities was the sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner on the senior debt transaction. In addition to the bank debt the acquisition was expedited through Providence's issuance of $70 million of Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due in 2014 which was arranged by RBC Capital Markets and closed on November 13 2007.\n\n\"To be able to generate an over subscribed syndication at the low end of the marketed range in this market is a strong statement of how lenders view this combination\" commented Fletcher McCusker Chairman and CEO.\n\nAnticipated accretion to Providence's 2008 earnings per share from the acquisition is estimated to be at the high end of the Company's previously stated range of $0.06 to $0.10.

We believe our focus on the front end of the Medicaid service delivery system which is designed to keep clients at home though combined transportation case management and home based social services is a powerful product array in the privatized arena.

{"pagetitle": ["\r\n\t\r\n\tA Game Time Decision by Michael Strauss of Commonfund"], "text": ["Published September 15 2015 \n\n Almost all the FOMC members recognize that domestic economic conditions have improved since the last meeting in July. However the deteriorating events internationally (China Russia and Brazil) combined with a likely near term moderation in inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines. Three Fed officials are likely to oppose changing monetary policy at this juncture. The final vote will be a game-time decision. \n\nFor the Fed the upward revision in 2015:Q2 real GDP from +2.3 percent to +3.7 percent was a signifi-cant event. Moreover the continued surge in housing activity and domestic vehicle sales at the start of 2015:Q3 shows that the U.S. consumer rather than the events in China remains the primary driver of our economy. \n\n\n\nThe September FOMC meeting will include a reassessment of economic forecasts by all the voting and non-voting Fed officials. This will in all likelihood result in an increase to its central tendency forecast for real GDP growth (currently understated at just 1.8 to 2.0 percent for 2015). They will also likely revise downward the unemployment rate estimate (currently overstated at 5.2 to 5.3 percent). Historically an upward revision to real growth (towards 2.5 percent) and a downward adjustment in the unemployment rate (to five percent or less) at this juncture in the economic cycle would increase the odds for normalizing interest rates. \n\n\n\nHowever the global economic and financial market challenges may still keep the FOMC in a holding pat-tern and merely set the stage for future potential action at either the late October or mid-December meet-ings. In either case the message from the Fed should include a focus on the better domestic economic conditions which we define as an increased likelihood for a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d economy\u2026. better domestic growth with less inflation. \n\n\n\n \n\nFed officials will likely de-emphasize the 173000 payroll print registered in August as it followed a com-bined 44000 in upward revisions the prior two months. The Fed should also be well aware of the fact that the BLS has underestimated the initial August payroll print in eight of the last 10 years. Last year the initial 142000 payroll print for August 2014 which sparked fear among market participants and the equity market when it was released was ultimately revised to a gain of 213000. \n\n\n\nThe economic impact of the slightly softer headline payroll print was also more than offset by the revi-sions and the gains in several key employment components. The average workweek rose 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours. Average hourly earnings rose a respectable 0.3 percent last month placing the yearly gain at 2.2 percent which continues to show real income growth. \n\n\n\nThe household employment series revealed a 196000 rise in household employment and a massive 237000 decline in household unemployment. The greater-than-expected drop in unemployment fueled a sharper-than-expected 0.2 percentage point decrease in the civilian unemployment rate to a new cycle low of 5.1 percent. The drop in the unemployment rate shows that labor market conditions remain solid and that the economy is moving closer to full employment at a faster pace than the Fed has been antici-pating. \n\n\n\nThe quality of employment improved dramatically for the second consecutive month as part-time workers got full-time jobs. Full-time worker employment increased 435000 in August after rising 536000 in July while part-time workers fell 349000 in August after a 402000 drop in July. The strength in the labor market was further validated by the latest JOLTS data (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) which revealed that the number of positions waiting to be filled surged by 430000 last month its biggest gain since 2010 to a record 5.75 million. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Fed\u2019s liftoff decision on monetary policy were solely based on U.S. domestic economic factors it would be easy for the FOMC to raise rates at the conclusion of the September 16 and 17 meeting. However setting monetary policy is more complicated than simply looking at domestic conditions. What is unfolding outside the U.S. will help to keep inflation lower for longer and may provide the FOMC with the opportunity to remain on the sidelines this week. \n\n\n\nGiven the international and financial market challenges and the dovish views from Fed Governor Brainard and Fed Presidents Evans and Williams the Fed funds futures are still pricing to a greater probability for no change in monetary policy (68 percent) at this week\u2019s meeting. Longstanding regional Fed Presidents Lacker and Lockhart are at the other end of the spectrum and are more likely to support a rise in rates. The net result is likely to push the FOMC to compromise by holding rates steady for now and start the normalization of monetary policy later this year. \n\n\n\nThe important message that Fed Chair Yellen is likely to deliver at the post-meeting press conference should be a positive tone on domestic economic conditions an appeasing view on inflation (including the benefits of lower input costs) and a cautious note on global events including the increase in volatility in the financial markets. Yellen is likely to provide strong hints that the Fed will eventually take steps to normalize the Fed funds rate target and the revised Fed forecasts should reveal that the most likely path to normalization will be a slow and gradual process that could take years to implement. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Published September 15 2015For the Fed the upward revision in 2015:Q2 real GDP from +2.3 percent to +3.7 percent was a signifi-cant event.

Full-time worker employment increased 435000 in August after rising 536000 in July while part-time workers fell 349000 in August after a 402000 drop in July. The strength in the labor market was further validated by the latest JOLTS data (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) which revealed that the number of positions waiting to be filled surged by 430000 last month its biggest gain since 2010 to a record 5.75 million.If the Fed\u2019s liftoff decision on monetary policy were solely based on U.S. domestic economic factors it would be easy for the FOMC to raise rates at the conclusion of the September 16 and 17 meeting. However setting monetary policy is more complicated than simply looking at domestic conditions. What is unfolding outside the U.S. will help to keep inflation lower for longer and may provide the FOMC with the opportunity to remain on the sidelines this week.Given the international and financial market challenges and the dovish views from Fed Governor Brainard and Fed Presidents Evans and Williams the Fed funds futures are still pricing to a greater probability for no change in monetary policy (68 percent) at this week\u2019s meeting. Longstanding regional Fed Presidents Lacker and Lockhart are at the other end of the spectrum and are more likely to support a rise in rates. The net result is likely to push the FOMC to compromise by holding rates steady for now and start the normalization of monetary policy later this year.The important message that Fed Chair Yellen is likely to deliver at the post-meeting press conference should be a positive tone on domestic economic conditions an appeasing view on inflation (including the benefits of lower input costs) and a cautious note on global events including the increase in volatility in the financial markets. Yellen is likely to provide strong hints that the Fed will eventually take steps to normalize the Fed funds rate target and the revised Fed forecasts should reveal that the most likely path to normalization will be a slow and gradual process that could take years to implement.

{"pagetitle": ["\r\n\t\r\n\tAugust-Correction-by-Nicholas-De-Monico"], "text": ["Today\u2019s global equity market sell-off combined with last week\u2019s declines has undoubtedly raised concerns among our investors who may question whether this marks the start of a prolonged downturn. As of the close of trading on August 24th the S&P 500 is approximately 11% below its peak of 2130 set on May 21st. Our short answer is simply that we believe this is a correction caused primarily by an economic slowdown in China.\n\n\n\nThe current economic slowdown in China was underscored by the devaluation of the Yuan on August 11th a decision viewed by many as a tacit admission by Chinese authorities that economic conditions were indeed worse than previously communicated.\u00a0 It is important to remember that economic slowdowns cause corrections not full blown bear markets.\u00a0 Bear markets are caused by recessions and thus far we see no evidence of a recession in either China or the developed markets.\n\n\n\nThat said we are admittedly in the mature phase of this bull market in equities which began in March of 2009.\u00a0 As we have stated several times in our letters to investors we expect more bouts of volatility as this bull market matures particularly as we approach the first interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\nAs reflected in the charts below\u00a0 at the outset of\u00a0 the last three Fed tightening cycles equity markets have experienced corrections of between six and nine percent. That we are having a correction now is consistent with that history.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been an unusually long period since the last significant sell off in the S&P 500. Almost a year ago the S&P 500 fell nearly seven percent driven by fears of the economic impact of Ebola.\u00a0\u00a0 Since then we have not experienced a correction of five percent or more. This is unusual and is counter to our view at the beginning of the year as we expected more volatility in advance of a Federal Reserve rate hike not less.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index has averaged almost three corrections of at least five percent per year in recent times with an average duration of 21 trading days. Given this history a correction of more than 5 percent was arguably overdue. The magnitude of this correction has been made worse by the fact that it is mid-August and daily trading volumes have generally been below their recent averages.\n\nAsset Allocation \n\nWe are holding the asset allocation mix that we had built prior to this correction.\u00a0 Specifically we are still overweight equities underweight fixed income and underweight commodities. In our equity allocation we are still slightly overweight the US slightly underweight Europe and Emerging Markets and overweight Japan.\u00a0 Earnings announcements for the second quarter of 2015 were largely positive particularly in Japan and Europe the two developed markets that are being hit the hardest in this China related sell-off.\n\nTo that point we strongly believed that we were in an improving environment for active management prior to this correction. This correction only strengthens that view. Securities become mispriced in violent sell-offs like the one we are currently experiencing.\u00a0 Given current market dislocations we believe that investing with active managers should provide better opportunities than merely investing in passive indices particularly in those markets that have been hit the hardest.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that we are taking the current situation lightly.\u00a0 We are keeping a close eye on a number of factors including credit spreads volatility emerging market currencies oil and leading economic indicators in both the emerging and developed markets.\u00a0\u00a0 But we want to reiterate our belief that this is a correction.\u00a0 We do not yet believe that this is the beginning of another bear market in global equities.\n\n\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nInformation opinions or commentary concerning the financial markets economic conditions or other topical subject matter are prepared written or created prior to printing and do not reflect current up-to-date market or economic conditions.

(\"Charterhouse\") today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its interest in Oakleaf Global Holdings Inc. (\"Oakleaf\" or the \"Company\") a leading provider of outsourced waste logistics solutions to New Mountain Partners II L.P. and New Mountain Partners III L.P. private equity funds sponsored by New Mountain Capital LLC (\"New Mountain\") in a transaction valued at $655 million.\n\nUnder Charterhouse's four year partnership with Oakleaf CEO and Founder Jim Barnes and his management team the Company has grown significantly to become North America's leading asset-light provider of outsourced waste logistics solutions. The Company successfully completed six add-on acquisitions between 2004 and 2007 broadly expanding the Company's service offering and diversifying its customer base.\n\nOakleaf manages national waste service contracts for a diverse group of corporations in the retail restaurant hospitality manufacturing and property management industries. The Company utilizes a network of local and regional waste haulers to provide non-hazardous waste collection services for its customers. Oakleaf is differentiated from others in the waste industry by its asset-light business model which reduces customer costs improves vendors' route density and encourages environmentally \"green\" alternatives to traditional waste disposal. At the Company's core is one of the most advanced customer and vendor management information technology platforms in the business process outsourcing industry. The Company's entrepreneurial management and state-of-the-art systems have revolutionized the waste services industry by providing comprehensive nationwide solutions to corporations.

Oakleaf exemplifies our partnership with industry leaders in emerging business service sub-sectors. The Company is well-positioned for future expansion and Charterhouse wishes management continued success as they work with New Mountain to take the business to the next level.\"\n\nThe sale of Oakleaf reflects the culmination of a well-executed Charterhouse Entrepreneur-focused build-up strategy. The Oakleaf strategy is consistent with Charterhouse's focus on sourcing proprietary deals and investment opportunities through its Entrepreneur relationships and creating value through well-developed buy-and-build strategies. It is also representative of Charterhouse's core thesis of targeting investments in differentiated asset-light and scaleable sectors that are uniquely-positioned for extraordinary growth. Since 1973 Charterhouse has consistently identified and partnered with seasoned executives and supported the growth of market leading companies.\n\nPaul Verrochi Charterhouse Entrepreneur and Oakleaf's Chairman stated \"It has been my pleasure to work closely with Jim and the Oakleaf team. The executives who work for Jim comprise one of the finest groups of managers that I have had the pleasure of dealing with during my 35 years in the service sector. They have built a solid and sustainable culture - second to none. I am proud to have overseen the six-fold revenue growth of this outstanding and dynamic company.\" Previous to his Charterhouse affiliation Mr. Verrochi was a founder of several businesses including American Medical Response Inc. a provider of ambulance services and Coach USA Inc. a provider of motorcoach charters tour and sightseeing services.\n\nJim Barnes stated: \"Paul Jay and the rest of the Charterhouse professionals have been great partners over the last four years. With their industry connections and deep transaction experience they brought more than just capital to the table. Charterhouse was incredibly resourceful and the insight and constructive support that we received enabled us to realize our vision of building an industry leader in a relatively short period of time.\"\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in mid-August.

{"pagetitle": ["The Energy & Minerals Group"], "text": ["HOUSTON TX & OVERLAND PARK KS \u2013 OCTOBER 13 2008\n\n NGP Midstream & Resources L.P. (\u201cM&R\u201d) and PTP Holdings LLC (\u201cPTP\u201d) announce today the formation of MLP Co-Investment Opportunity Fund L.P. MLP Co-Investment Opportunity Fund L.P. (the \u201cFund\u201d) will focus on making equity investments in publicly traded securities issued by Master Limited Partnerships or pre-IPO entities that are expected to become publicly traded with an emphasis on companies with operations addressing the midstream energy sector energy infrastructure and natural resources industries. The Fund may also make limited portfolio investments in equity securities that are not expected to be freely tradable again within the broad energy sector. The Fund size is targeted at $750 million of equity commitments with targeted leverage ratios to allow the Fund (when fully capitalized) to have approximately $1 billion in assets under management. M&R and PTP will each own a fifty percent interest in the General Partner and Manager of the Fund. In addition M&R and PTP have made capital commitments as limited partners of the\n\n Fund and through their ownership of the general partner which aggregate in excess of $156 million. PTP is a newly formed entity controlled and majority-owned by Mr. David G. Dehaemers Jr. Mr. Dehaemers has assembled a management team with extensive principal experience in\n\n working in conjunction with and for Master Limited Partnerships. Mr. Dehaemers and the PTP management team will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund including its General Partner and Manager. Prior to his affiliation with the Fund Mr. Dehaemers led as a member of senior management successful public companies in the MLP energy sector. Those companies include Kinder\n\n Morgan Energy Partners L.P. and Inergy L.P. and their respective general partners. For 12 years out of his 17 years in the energy sector he has been the CFO or Executive Vice President for Corporate Development of these MLPs. In those roles he oversaw more than $5.2 billion of acquisitions and mergers in excess of $9 billion. He is well acquainted with numerous assets in the energy midstream sector and has extensive experience acquiring structuring and combining\n\n energy assets. The Fund sponsors believe that such principal experience is an imperative construct for the Fund to successfully evaluate the assets operations and strategies of Fund target\n\n companies. Mr. Dehaemers will be responsible for directing the Fund\u2019s strategic and investment activities and managing the Fund\u2019s investment portfolio and day-to-day investment sourcing\n\n efforts. Mr. Dehaemers skill set with experience in accounting tax legal and merger/acquisition matters will be applied to the selection of appropriate portfolio companies. In discussing the rationale for forming the Fund Mr. Dehaemers stated: \u201cWe believe that Master Limited Partnerships as a whole will be a focal point of a major investment cycle to be implemented in the North American energy infrastructure over the next 15 to 20 years. Enormous amounts of capital will be needed in order to fund capacity expansion projects and such need will provide significant investment opportunities for those partnerships and their investors that are appropriately positioned. We believe that this demand for infrastructure expansion and for capital will create compelling investment opportunities for the Fund.\u201d Investments to be made by the Fund will be selected and approved by Mr. Dehaemers and Mr. John T. Raymond. Mr. Raymond is a founder of Managing Partner and Chief Executive\n\n Officer of M&R. In addressing M&R\u2019s interest in participating in the Fund Mr. Raymond said: \u201cM&R remains committed to identifying opportunities to participate and invest in the demand for capital created by expansion of the country\u2019s energy infrastructure. We are excited to participate with David Dehaemers and the management team that he has assembled in order to focus investment efforts on publicly traded partnerships that are expected to play a significant role in the infrastructure\n\n build-out process.\u201d Mr. Raymond added: \u201cThe expansion and development of our nation\u2019s energy infrastructure will remain a dominant long term secular theme that will consume enormous amounts of capital in\n\n both the public and private sectors. To this end a vehicle that focuses on publicly traded partnerships that will play a significant role in the buildout of energy infrastructure is a logical extension of M&R\u2019s strategic initiatives. We are pleased to form this venture with David and his management team to execute against this strategy.\u201d Mr. Dehaemers continued: \u201cWe are honored to partner with M&R in launching this new venture. M&R has a proven track record of success that we hope to extend and build upon. We look forward to working with M&R to implement an aggressive and disciplined investment approach for the Fund.\u201d NGP Midstream & Resources a U.S.-based $1.4 billion private equity fund invests in selected areas of the energy infrastructure and natural resources sectors.
