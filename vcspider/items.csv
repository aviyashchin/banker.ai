                        PITTSBURGH, OMAHA and NEW YORK – June 7, 2013 – H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ)
                        (“Heinz”) today announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition by an investment consortium comprised of Berkshire Hathaway and an investment fund affiliated with 3G Capital. The acquisition agreement was first announced on February 14 and the transaction closed and became effective today. 
                    
                        Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by Heinz’s
                        Board of Directors, Heinz shareholders will receive $72.50 in cash for each share
                        of common stock they own, in a transaction valued at $28 billion, including the
                        assumption of Heinz’s outstanding debt. The per share price represents a 20% premium
                        to Heinz’s closing share price of $60.48 on February 13, 2013, a 19% premium to
                        Heinz’s all-time high share price, a 23% premium to the 90-day average Heinz share
                        price and a 30% premium to the one-year average share price.

                        Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by Heinz’s
                        Board of Directors, Heinz shareholders will receive $72.50 in cash for each share
                        of common stock they own, in a transaction valued at $28 billion, including the
                        assumption of Heinz’s outstanding debt. The per share price represents a 20% premium
                        to Heinz’s closing share price of $60.48 on February 13, 2013, a 19% premium to
                        Heinz’s all-time high share price, a 23% premium to the 90-day average Heinz share
                        price and a 30% premium to the one-year average share price.

                        PITTSBURGH, OMAHA and NEW YORK – June 7, 2013 – H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ)
                        (“Heinz”) today announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition by an investment consortium comprised of Berkshire Hathaway and an investment fund affiliated with 3G Capital. The acquisition agreement was first announced on February 14 and the transaction closed and became effective today. 
                    
                        Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by Heinz’s
                        Board of Directors, Heinz shareholders will receive $72.50 in cash for each share
                        of common stock they own, in a transaction valued at $28 billion, including the
                        assumption of Heinz’s outstanding debt. The per share price represents a 20% premium
                        to Heinz’s closing share price of $60.48 on February 13, 2013, a 19% premium to
                        Heinz’s all-time high share price, a 23% premium to the 90-day average Heinz share
                        price and a 30% premium to the one-year average share price.

                        APPROACH
                    
                        3G Capital's strategy is to identify and invest in opportunities that are well-positioned
                            for profitable, long-term growth and success across a variety of different sectors
                            and regions. The firm's management team leverages prior investment experience, industry
                            expertise and an extensive global network to successfully implement this strategy.
                        3G Capital's core management philosophy focuses on developing and retaining top
                            tier talent.
                        3G Capital and its affiliates have particular expertise in the retail and consumer
                            sector and consistently evaluate new opportunities for successful investments in
                            this industry.
                        In order to preserve capital and maximize value, 3G Capital believes that factoring
                            in the downside of an investment is equally as important as the upside potential.
                            This philosophy has helped the firm weather various global economic cycles.
                        3G Capital operates as a true partnership with strong meritocracy, and therefore
                            there is significant alignment of interests among 3G Capital's Principals & Partners
                            and relevant management teams.

                        PITTSBURGH, OMAHA and NEW YORK – June 7, 2013 – H.J. Heinz Company (NYSE: HNZ)
                        (“Heinz”) today announced the completion of its previously announced acquisition by an investment consortium comprised of Berkshire Hathaway and an investment fund affiliated with 3G Capital. The acquisition agreement was first announced on February 14 and the transaction closed and became effective today. 
                    
                        Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by Heinz’s
                        Board of Directors, Heinz shareholders will receive $72.50 in cash for each share
                        of common stock they own, in a transaction valued at $28 billion, including the
                        assumption of Heinz’s outstanding debt. The per share price represents a 20% premium
                        to Heinz’s closing share price of $60.48 on February 13, 2013, a 19% premium to
                        Heinz’s all-time high share price, a 23% premium to the 90-day average Heinz share
                        price and a 30% premium to the one-year average share price.

                        APPROACH
                    
                        3G Capital's strategy is to identify and invest in opportunities that are well-positioned
                            for profitable, long-term growth and success across a variety of different sectors
                            and regions. The firm's management team leverages prior investment experience, industry
                            expertise and an extensive global network to successfully implement this strategy.
                        3G Capital's core management philosophy focuses on developing and retaining top
                            tier talent.
                        3G Capital and its affiliates have particular expertise in the retail and consumer
                            sector and consistently evaluate new opportunities for successful investments in
                            this industry.
                        In order to preserve capital and maximize value, 3G Capital believes that factoring
                            in the downside of an investment is equally as important as the upside potential.
                            This philosophy has helped the firm weather various global economic cycles.
                        3G Capital operates as a true partnership with strong meritocracy, and therefore
                            there is significant alignment of interests among 3G Capital's Principals & Partners
                            and relevant management teams.

                        3G Capital's strategy is to identify and invest in opportunities that are well-positioned
                            for profitable, long-term growth and success across a variety of different sectors
                            and regions. The firm's management team leverages prior investment experience, industry
                            expertise and an extensive global network to successfully implement this strategy.
                        3G Capital's core management philosophy focuses on developing and retaining top
                            tier talent.
                        3G Capital and its affiliates have particular expertise in the retail and consumer
                            sector and consistently evaluate new opportunities for successful investments in
                            this industry.
                        In order to preserve capital and maximize value, 3G Capital believes that factoring
                            in the downside of an investment is equally as important as the upside potential.
                            This philosophy has helped the firm weather various global economic cycles.
                        3G Capital operates as a true partnership with strong meritocracy, and therefore
                            there is significant alignment of interests among 3G Capital's Principals & Partners
                            and relevant management teams.
