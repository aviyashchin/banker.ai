This information represents past performance. It is possible that you may lose money on an investment in any Commonfund fund or on any other investment in stocks or bonds or other instruments to which this Site may be deemed to relate directly or indirectly. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. Income from investments may fluctuate.\n\n\n\nSmall Cap Stocks\n\nThe securities of small less well-known companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies.\n\n\n\nInternational Securities\n\nInvestments in foreign securities involve greater risks than U.S. investments. These risks include the political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuation. Changes in rates of exchange may have an adverse effect on the value price of or income derived from an investment.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness Continuity\n\nCommonfund has developed a business continuity plan that is designed to minimize the impact of computer or facilities related emergencies or external events such as a natural disaster on Commonfund and our ability to provide service to our clients. The goal of our plan is that we will continue or resume as quickly as possible critical business operations during these types of disruptions.\n\n\n\nOur plan addresses the actions that we will take in the event that the significant disruption affects a single building a business district a citywide area or an entire region. We have different planned recovery times depending on the severity of the significant business disruption. In most of the scenarios addressed by our plan we anticipate recovery times within 24 hours from the significant business disruption. Even in the most significant business disruption scenario addressed by our plan we anticipate that critical business operations could be resumed within five days.\n\n\n\nTo support our Business Continuity Plan recovery times we maintain a back-up facility including a secondary data center for all of our branches. Our back-up facility is located well away from our primary facilities so that it would not be affected by a regional disruption. Account access would be available through the data center at our back-up facility. Our plan will be reviewed updated and tested periodically. If a material change to the plan occurs this Notice of Business Continuity Preparedness will be updated as appropriate. We may modify this notice at any time with such modifications becoming effective upon posting to our web site. You may obtain a current copy of this notice by clicking here or Commonfund will mail you a copy upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\n Miscellaneous\n\nThis agreement has been made in and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with New York law. Any action to enforce this Agreement shall be brought in the federal or state courts located in New York City.\n\n\n\nNotice of Anti-Money Laundering Customer Identification Requirements Important information about procedures for opening a new account:\n\nTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain verify and record information that identifies each customer who opens an account.\n\n\n\nWhat this means for you: When you open an account we may ask for documents or information related to: your principal place of business local office or other physical location; taxpayer identification number; and other documents demonstrating your lawful existence such as certified articles of incorporation a government-issued business license a partnership agreement or a trust agreement and other identifying documents.\n\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nThis policy governs the manner in which Commonfund safeguards Social Security numbers collected from investors and Commonfund personnel. The purpose of this policy is to establish measures by which to safeguard Social Security numbers and to minimize the abuses associated with the fraudulent use of Social Security numbers by attempting to restrict their use as an identifier.\n\n\n\nCommonfund personnel (including without limitation employees and contractors) and anyone accessing Commonfund\u2019s non-public computer systems shall not:\n\n\n\n1. Communicate or otherwise make available to the general public any individual\u2019s Social Security number;\n\n\n\n2.

Intentionally print or embed an individual\u2019s Social Security number on any card required for an investor or employee to access products services or benefits;\n\n\n\n4. Require an individual to transmit the individual\u2019s Social Security number over the Internet or to store Social Security numbers on any laptop or other portable computing device unless the connection is secure or the Social Security number is encrypted in accordance with Commonfund\u2019s Information Security Policy;\n\n\n\n5.Require an individual to use the individual\u2019s Social Security number to access an Internet website unless a password or unique personal identification number or other authentication device is also required to access the Internet website; \n\n\n\n6.Print an individual\u2019s Social Security number on any materials that are mailed (including facsimile and e-mail) unless required by law or on documents sent as part of an application an amendment or termination of the account in which case the number may not be on a postcard or visible through an envelope. Approval from the Information Security Policy Program Administrator is required for inclusion of Social Security numbers in a mailing;\n\n\n\n7.Require use of a Social Security number as an ID number;\n\n\n\n8.Display a Social Security number on any document intended to be recorded by a county recorder;\n\n\n\n9. Use a Social Security number as a PIN code;\n\n\n\n10.

Commonfund personnel must consult with the Information Security Policy Program Administrator if they are unsure whether use of a Social Security number is permissible in a particular situation.\n\nOur website describes enterprise risk management objectives and processes many of which are employed by Commonfund and its affiliates (\u201cCommonfund Group\u201d). Potential investors in any Commonfund Group investment programs should understand that there can be no assurance that risk management and mitigation processes will anticipate or prevent investment losses. In particular risk analytics based on past events may not successfully predict or model future events. Certain procedures described in the presentation represent steps that Commonfund Group normally seeks to complete as part of its enterprise risk management program; however there can be no assurance that each such step will be completed as described for all periods and all investment programs. Enterprise risk management is a dynamic and resource-intensive process and Commonfund Group personnel may from time to time forego certain procedures that may be described in this presentation in order to focus on alternative procedures or other pressing issues.\n\nPotential investors in Commonfund Group investment programs should always prior to any investment review with care any disclosure or related subscription materials (including any Confidential Offering Memorandum or similar document) for a description of possible investment-related and other risks. Nothing in this presentation is intended to constitute an offering of any Commonfund Group investment program.\n\nCertain portions of the foregoing presentation may indicate the viewpoint of Commonfund\u2019s Risk Management team or general economic analysis by Commonfund Group with respect to past or current market conditions. These views are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to constitute investment recommendations to any recipient. Furthermore these materials only reflect the knowledge and viewpoint of Commonfund Group as of the dates indicated within them and Commonfund Group disclaims any obligation to update or revise them to reflect subsequent events or information.']}

 'text': [u'Grasping at Straws When Reaching for Yield?\n\nBy Alec Rapaport Managing Director Head of Fixed Income Strategies \n\n\n\nPublished September 2015\u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."\xa0 - George Santayana\n\n\n\nIt feels a little like the movie Groundhog Day where Bill Murray wakes up in Punxsutawney PA repeatedly reliving the same day. As in the movie the overwhelming cycle of fear and forgetfulness seems to be playing out once again in the credit markets. Globally central banks have adopted policy stances which offer investors negative real yields on deposits. Money is not a store of value and investors have the privilege of paying others for its \u2018safekeeping\u2019. Investors have been desperate for yield and we cannot help but ask: are they grasping at straws?\n\n\n\nAfter the 2008 credit crisis investors were focused on return of capital not return on capital. Understandably investors were highly cautious following the pain and tumult they had endured from mid-2007 to early-2009. Safety and certainty were the buzzwords of the day. Risk aversion stayed high as the credit crisis moved from the United States to Europe and then back to the U.S. as the debt limit debates began. However over the past few years we\u2019ve seen investors\u2019 fears diminish and the demand for yield re-emerge.\n\n\n\nToday the market is replete with \u2018Unconstrained\u2019 and \u2018Strategic Income\u2019 products. We like to call them \u2018credit and illiquidity in disguise\u2019. While fixed income investors know that credit is cyclical that concept tends to be forgotten somewhere between the top and bottom of the cycle. While we do not think we are at the top of the cycle just yet we do think we are far closer to the top than the bottom in terms of return versus risk and the re-emergence and popularity of strategic income products is just one indication.\n\n\n\nThe world is flush with liquidity generously provided by not just central banks but also by individual and institutional investors. Mutual fund flows into fixed income have been tremendous although have slowed since the \u2018taper tantrum.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nAs market participants shift their focus from risk aversion to profit maximization investors creep further along the risk spectrum and slowly (or sometimes quickly) capital finds the next good thing. Initially in late 2008 it was non-Treasury government-backed bonds. The FDIC-insured financial paper issued under the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) was issued by banks and was insured by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government through the FDIC. Despite this they were initially issued at spreads nearly 200 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. Eventually investors caught on spreads plunged and prices moved higher. As investor comfort increased so did the demand for yield. There was the initial move back towards asset-backed securities backed by auto loans and credit card receivables which evolved into shorter maturity high grade corporate bonds. Surely people would still shop at Walmart and buy toothpaste made by Proctor & Gamble so their debt must be okay too. And so went the cycle slowly moving down in quality and out in maturity as those first tentative steps became more purposeful strides. Today spreads are likely near fair value generally near their long-term averages and typically reflective of generally solid underlying fundamentals. We continue to see signs of bad behavior (from a bond perspective) such as increasing dividends share buybacks debt financed acquisition and a move toward increased financial leverage at the company level.\n\n\n\nAt this stage in the credit cycle it is especially important to thoroughly assess the underlying risks of any investment. Several investors have expressed interest in strategic income funds and while there is nothing fundamentally wrong with these products it is important that investors understand what\u2019s under the hood.\n\n\n\nStrategic income funds generally have exposure to a variety of fixed income sectors all of which tend to have higher yields or expected returns in order to compensate investors for taking various risks. In a typical strategic income fund you will find holdings such as non-agency mortgages bank loans emerging markets debt credit default swaps and collateralized loan obligations. They may also have forms of long-short positioning.\n\n\n\nOver the years we have been asked by investors to look into various strategic income programs; one program in particular was from a well-known asset manager. Our investor believed that this program would protect their assets in a rising interest rate environment and generate very attractive yield. We looked at basic information on the fund in question and started by diagnosing its historical record. At first glance the record was short but looked reasonably good. The first caveat however was an inception date after 2008; there was a limited data set and the fund had the benefit of being a buyer putting money to work in the midst of the worst credit and liquidity crisis post World War II. Next we scanned top holdings which showed some Treasuries and agencies and a few large well-known corporates and a lot of cash. This was the second caveat. Duration was short inside a year which should protect investors from rising rates - no red flag there. The fund\u2019s indicated yield was high as expected. When we took a closer look at the holdings we found that the fund held a significant exposure to high yield bonds and credit default swaps. We also found non-agency mortgages agency mortgage derivatives and swaps on derivative mortgages. These are areas of the fixed income markets that offer interesting opportunities but also come with substantial risks. As we all know there is no such thing as a free lunch and investors considering strategic income funds could be taking risks they are not aware of or for which they are not being compensated and paying a premium in fees to do so.\n\n\n\nKeeping on the topic of risk in a basic sense the market is a reasonable pricing mechanism. For a given level of compensation (think yield or internal rate of return) there are certain risks a fixed income investor takes on such as interest rate risk credit risk liquidity risk and structure risk. You usually end up taking on a few of these risks in combination with a \u2018strategic income\u2019 portfolio specifically credit structure and liquidity risk while interest rate risk is avoided. We think the basic misinterpretation is that strategic income portfolios and their respective portfolio managers can generate above market returns with below market risk. Our contention is that generally as a group they are taking market risks and earning market returns but that the manager\u2019s broad and varied sector allocations may obscure this. This is exacerbated by discounting those risks in the hope of finding a better fixed income mousetrap.\n\n\n\nAll fixed income securities have credit liquidity and structural risks and we want our investors to under-stand the risks as well as the rewards and know what the trade-offs are in their portfolios. That requires a strong understanding of the cyclical nature of the fixed income markets specifically the credit cycle. At this point in the cycle the risks shift from the more obvious to the more insidious. Attractive opportunities in larger more liquid instruments have waned and issuers seem to have the upper hand. Credit-worthy corporations demand favorable terms with low coupons and light covenants. Investor demand over-whelms supply and borrowers start to dictate terms. A few years ago lenders (bond buyers) had the upper hand and would dictate new issue concessions on price and force tighter covenant packages to pro-tect themselves. In today\u2019s world however investors are allowing their capital to slowly ooze into the cracks and crevices of off-the-run debt instruments be it subordinated tranches of mortgage securities or smaller less robust issuers to name a few. In return they are now receiving relatively paltry compensa-tion that a few years ago would have made them wrinkle their nose. This cycle will continue as easier lending terms and an improving economy continue to embolden borrowers and users of capital to take on more debt and leverage their businesses or household balance sheets. Our fear is that they will ride the wave of economic improvement and leave the idea of a credit cycle as an increasingly distant memory.\n\n\n\n\u2003\n\nIn fixed income the illusion of a \u2018free lunch\u2019 manifests itself in that incessant demand for yield when yield is no longer cheap. If yield is the goal we think is important to truly understand the risks. While we might be on a glide path similar to the 1995-1997 or 2004-2006 periods opportunities are fewer and risks are greater.\n\n\n\nFixed income investments have moved back towards their usual position of having more downside than upside with prices at or above par for most sectors and spreads near their long-term averages. This means that to earn outsized returns in fixed income an investor will be taking on increasing levels of credit liquidity and structural risk. These risks are more closely related to equity risk to which most investors already have significant exposure. Should we experience a significantly negative equity market or substantial increase in volatility investors should understand the downside risks inherent in these portfolios and make a prudent and thoughtful decision on the acceptable level of risk exposure in these products.\n\n\n\nIn today\u2019s market there aren\u2019t a lot of obvious opportunities in the credit market. As mentioned earlier the market is a relatively efficient pricing mechanism and no one sector seems to offer tremendous opportunity. As investors reach down in quality and liquidity or go up in legal or structural complexity market risk compensation increases but nowhere do we see highly attractive valuations. At this point in the cycle we do not believe there is a need to rush for the exit but we are reticent to recommend investors increase their exposure to spread risk factors. Before investing in the latest and greatest fixed income product have a look under the hood and be sure to understand what\u2019s driving the risk and return.\n\nInformation opinions or commentary concerning the financial markets economic conditions or other topical subject matter are prepared written or created prior to printing and do not reflect current up-to-date market or economic conditions.

 'text': [u'Today\u2019s global equity market sell-off combined with last week\u2019s declines has undoubtedly raised concerns among our investors who may question whether this marks the start of a prolonged downturn. As of the close of trading on August 24th the S&P 500 is approximately 11% below its peak of 2130 set on May 21st. Our short answer is simply that we believe this is a correction caused primarily by an economic slowdown in China.\n\n\n\nThe current economic slowdown in China was underscored by the devaluation of the Yuan on August 11th a decision viewed by many as a tacit admission by Chinese authorities that economic conditions were indeed worse than previously communicated.\xa0 It is important to remember that economic slowdowns cause corrections not full blown bear markets.\xa0 Bear markets are caused by recessions and thus far we see no evidence of a recession in either China or the developed markets.\n\n\n\nThat said we are admittedly in the mature phase of this bull market in equities which began in March of 2009.\xa0 As we have stated several times in our letters to investors we expect more bouts of volatility as this bull market matures particularly as we approach the first interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\nAs reflected in the charts below\xa0 at the outset of\xa0 the last three Fed tightening cycles equity markets have experienced corrections of between six and nine percent. That we are having a correction now is consistent with that history.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has been an unusually long period since the last significant sell off in the S&P 500. Almost a year ago the S&P 500 fell nearly seven percent driven by fears of the economic impact of Ebola.\xa0\xa0 Since then we have not experienced a correction of five percent or more. This is unusual and is counter to our view at the beginning of the year as we expected more volatility in advance of a Federal Reserve rate hike not less.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index has averaged almost three corrections of at least five percent per year in recent times with an average duration of 21 trading days. Given this history a correction of more than 5 percent was arguably overdue. The magnitude of this correction has been made worse by the fact that it is mid-August and daily trading volumes have generally been below their recent averages.\n\nAsset Allocation \n\nWe are holding the asset allocation mix that we had built prior to this correction.\xa0 Specifically we are still overweight equities underweight fixed income and underweight commodities. In our equity allocation we are still slightly overweight the US slightly underweight Europe and Emerging Markets and overweight Japan.\xa0 Earnings announcements for the second quarter of 2015 were largely positive particularly in Japan and Europe the two developed markets that are being hit the hardest in this China related sell-off.\n\nTo that point we strongly believed that we were in an improving environment for active management prior to this correction. This correction only strengthens that view. Securities become mispriced in violent sell-offs like the one we are currently experiencing.\xa0 Given current market dislocations we believe that investing with active managers should provide better opportunities than merely investing in passive indices particularly in those markets that have been hit the hardest.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that we are taking the current situation lightly.\xa0 We are keeping a close eye on a number of factors including credit spreads volatility emerging market currencies oil and leading economic indicators in both the emerging and developed markets.\xa0\xa0 But we want to reiterate our belief that this is a correction.\xa0 We do not yet believe that this is the beginning of another bear market in global equities.\n\n\n\n*Past performance is not indicative of future results.\n\nInformation opinions or commentary concerning the financial markets economic conditions or other topical subject matter are prepared written or created prior to printing and do not reflect current up-to-date market or economic conditions.

 'text': [u'Published September 15 2015 \n\n Almost all the FOMC members recognize that domestic economic conditions have improved since the last meeting in July. However the deteriorating events internationally (China Russia and Brazil) combined with a likely near term moderation in inflation could keep the Fed on the sidelines. Three Fed officials are likely to oppose changing monetary policy at this juncture. The final vote will be a game-time decision. \n\nFor the Fed the upward revision in 2015:Q2 real GDP from +2.3 percent to +3.7 percent was a signifi-cant event. Moreover the continued surge in housing activity and domestic vehicle sales at the start of 2015:Q3 shows that the U.S. consumer rather than the events in China remains the primary driver of our economy. \n\n\n\nThe September FOMC meeting will include a reassessment of economic forecasts by all the voting and non-voting Fed officials. This will in all likelihood result in an increase to its central tendency forecast for real GDP growth (currently understated at just 1.8 to 2.0 percent for 2015). They will also likely revise downward the unemployment rate estimate (currently overstated at 5.2 to 5.3 percent). Historically an upward revision to real growth (towards 2.5 percent) and a downward adjustment in the unemployment rate (to five percent or less) at this juncture in the economic cycle would increase the odds for normalizing interest rates. \n\n\n\nHowever the global economic and financial market challenges may still keep the FOMC in a holding pat-tern and merely set the stage for future potential action at either the late October or mid-December meet-ings. In either case the message from the Fed should include a focus on the better domestic economic conditions which we define as an increased likelihood for a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d economy\u2026. better domestic growth with less inflation. \n\n\n\n \n\nFed officials will likely de-emphasize the 173000 payroll print registered in August as it followed a com-bined 44000 in upward revisions the prior two months. The Fed should also be well aware of the fact that the BLS has underestimated the initial August payroll print in eight of the last 10 years. Last year the initial 142000 payroll print for August 2014 which sparked fear among market participants and the equity market when it was released was ultimately revised to a gain of 213000. \n\n\n\nThe economic impact of the slightly softer headline payroll print was also more than offset by the revi-sions and the gains in several key employment components. The average workweek rose 0.1 hour to 34.6 hours. Average hourly earnings rose a respectable 0.3 percent last month placing the yearly gain at 2.2 percent which continues to show real income growth. \n\n\n\nThe household employment series revealed a 196000 rise in household employment and a massive 237000 decline in household unemployment. The greater-than-expected drop in unemployment fueled a sharper-than-expected 0.2 percentage point decrease in the civilian unemployment rate to a new cycle low of 5.1 percent. The drop in the unemployment rate shows that labor market conditions remain solid and that the economy is moving closer to full employment at a faster pace than the Fed has been antici-pating. \n\n\n\nThe quality of employment improved dramatically for the second consecutive month as part-time workers got full-time jobs. Full-time worker employment increased 435000 in August after rising 536000 in July while part-time workers fell 349000 in August after a 402000 drop in July. The strength in the labor market was further validated by the latest JOLTS data (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) which revealed that the number of positions waiting to be filled surged by 430000 last month its biggest gain since 2010 to a record 5.75 million. \n\n\n\n\n\nIf the Fed\u2019s liftoff decision on monetary policy were solely based on U.S. domestic economic factors it would be easy for the FOMC to raise rates at the conclusion of the September 16 and 17 meeting. However setting monetary policy is more complicated than simply looking at domestic conditions. What is unfolding outside the U.S. will help to keep inflation lower for longer and may provide the FOMC with the opportunity to remain on the sidelines this week. \n\n\n\nGiven the international and financial market challenges and the dovish views from Fed Governor Brainard and Fed Presidents Evans and Williams the Fed funds futures are still pricing to a greater probability for no change in monetary policy (68 percent) at this week\u2019s meeting. Longstanding regional Fed Presidents Lacker and Lockhart are at the other end of the spectrum and are more likely to support a rise in rates. The net result is likely to push the FOMC to compromise by holding rates steady for now and start the normalization of monetary policy later this year. \n\n\n\nThe important message that Fed Chair Yellen is likely to deliver at the post-meeting press conference should be a positive tone on domestic economic conditions an appeasing view on inflation (including the benefits of lower input costs) and a cautious note on global events including the increase in volatility in the financial markets. Yellen is likely to provide strong hints that the Fed will eventually take steps to normalize the Fed funds rate target and the revised Fed forecasts should reveal that the most likely path to normalization will be a slow and gradual process that could take years to implement. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n Published September 15 2015For the Fed the upward revision in 2015:Q2 real GDP from +2.3 percent to +3.7 percent was a signifi-cant event.

 'text': [u'\u2019s-Hertogenbosch the Netherlands 6 August 2015 \u2013 Van Lanschot has signed an agreement with an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP on the sale of part of its portfolio of nonperforming commercial real estate loans. At a face value of over \u20ac 400 million this transaction will accelerate the runoff of the non-core corporate loan portfolio that started in 2013.Karl Guha Chairman of Van Lanschot\u2019s Executive Board: \u201cThis is a next step in the implementation of our wealth management strategy which focuses on activities contributing to the preservation and the creation of wealth for our private and institutional clients. Structured as a competitive bidding process the transaction allows us to benefit from market opportunities in this segment and we are pleased to have found an experienced and reliable party to manage the portfolio professionally.\u201d\n\nIn 2013 Van Lanschot announced its intention to halve the risk weighted assets of its corporate loan portfolio over a four-year period. The sale significantly reduces the risk profile of the corporate banking loan book and will have a positive impact on loan loss provisions going forward. As a result of this transaction the impaired ratio of the overall loan book of Van Lanschot (5.8% at YE 2014) reduces by more than 2.5 percentage points on a pro forma basis. The transaction is expected to result in a one-off charge of approximately \u20ac23 million (before tax) in the second half of 2015 and will have a marginally positive impact on Van Lanschot\u2019s core capital position.\n\nFollowing the transaction Van Lanschot will continue to run down the remaining portfolio (with an outstanding principal of \u20ac3.1 billion as per 31 December 2014) managed by its Corporate Bank.\n\nThe transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2015.\n\nAbout Van Lanschot\n\n Van Lanschot NV is the holding company of F. van Lanschot Bankiers NV the oldest independent bank in the Netherlands with a history dating back to 1737. Van Lanschot a wealth manager operating under the Van Lanschot and Kempen & Co brand names is active in Private Banking Asset Management and Merchant Banking with the aim of preserving and creating wealth for its clients. Van Lanschot NV is listed at Euronext in Amsterdam.\n\nAbout Cerberus Capital Management L.P.\n\n Established in 1992 Cerberus Capital Management L.P. is one of the world\u2019s leading private investment firms. Cerberus has more than US $25 billion under management invested in four primary strategies: distressed securities & assets; control and non-control private equity; commercial mid-market lending and real estate-related investments.
