Commonfund and our ability to provide service to our clients The goal of our plan is that we will continue or resume as quickly as possible critical business operations during these types of disruptionsOur plan addresses the actions that we will take in the event that the significant disruption affects a single building a business district a citywide area or an entire region We have different planned recovery times depending on the severity of the significant business disruption In most of the scenarios addressed by our plan we anticipate recovery times within 24 hours from the significant business disruption Even in the most significant business disruption scenario addressed by our plan we anticipate that critical business operations could be resumed within five daysTo support our Business Continuity Plan recovery times we maintain a back-up facility including a secondary data center for all of our branches Our back-up facility is located well away from our primary facilities so that it would not be affected by a regional disruption Account access would be available through the data center at our back-up facility Our plan will be reviewed updated and tested periodically If a material change to the plan occurs this Notice of Business Continuity Preparedness will be updated as appropriate We may modify this notice at any time with such modifications

by Commonfund and its affiliates (\u201cCommonfund Group\u201d) Potential investors in any Commonfund Group investment programs should understand that there can be no assurance that risk management and mitigation processes will anticipate or prevent investment losses In particular risk analytics based on past events may not successfully predict or model future events Certain procedures described in the presentation represent steps that Commonfund Group normally seeks to complete as part of its enterprise risk management program; however there can be no assurance that each such step will be completed as described for all periods and all investment programs Enterprise risk management is a dynamic and resource-intensive process and Commonfund Group personnel may from time to time forego certain procedures that may be described in this presentation in order to focus on alternative procedures or other pressing issues Potential investors in Commonfund Group investment programs should

investment-related and other risks Nothing in this presentation is intended to constitute an offering of any Commonfund Group investment program Certain portions of the foregoing presentation may
