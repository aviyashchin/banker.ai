 'text': [u"ABSOLUTE RETURN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES SSARIS PHILOSOPHY CONVERGENT/DIVERGENT STRATEGIES \u2020Please Note: This is for illustrative purposes only and is not meant to depict the performance of any specific investment. SSARIS' investment philosophy reflects a core belief that markets behave rationally most of the time however they become irrational from time to time and for prolonged periods. At a strategic level hedge fund strategies can be divided into two categories: convergent strategies and divergent strategies. Convergent strategies focus on overvalued/undervalued situations that seek to perform well in periods of stable or declining volatility while divergent strategies seek to perform well during periods of rising volatility. SSARIS believes that for a portfolio to have the ability to generate consistent absolute returns in any economic environment the portfolio should consist of both types of strategies. Various members of the Executive Management Team of SSARIS have worked together for over 25 years of managing hedge fund strategies. This has only served to reinforce the philosophy of generating absolute returns. \xa0 SSARIS Advisors LLC. | \xa9 2012 SSARIS ADVISORS LLC. All rights reserved. VER. 1.2|Env:PROD"]}

 'text': [u"ABSOLUTE RETURN INVESTMENT STRATEGIES RISKS OF HEDGE FUND INVESTING Risks of Hedge Fund Investing Investing in hedge funds involves a high degree of risk. They may involve potential loss of principal; be highly illiquid; and may charge higher fees which may offset any trading profits. Alternative investments are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as registered investment products and often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. In many cases they have underlying investments that are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager. They may also involve complex tax structures and experience delays in distributing important tax information. The performance of alternative investments can be volatile and an investor could lose all or a substantial amount of his or her investment. There is no secondary market for hedge fund interests and transfers of interests are subject to limitations. A substantial portion of a hedge fund's trades may take place on foreign exchanges that may not offer the same regulatory protection as U.S. exchanges. Specific sector investing can be subject to different and greater risks than more diversified investments. A hedge fund of funds invests in other funds and fees are charged at both the fund and sub-fund level. Thus the overall fees you will pay will be higher than you would pay by investing directly in the sub-funds. Diversification and strategic asset allocation do not assure profit or protect against loss in declining markets. This summary of certain risks is not a complete list of the risks involved in investing in alternative investments and is subject to more complete disclosures contained in a specific alternative investment's respective offering documents which must be reviewed carefully. Investors should consult with their investment counselors and tax advisors to determine whether a investment in hedge funds is appropriate for them. \xa0 SSARIS Advisors LLC. | \xa9 2012 SSARIS ADVISORS LLC.

The goal of our plan is that we will continue or resume as quickly as possible critical business operations during these types of disruptions.Our plan addresses the actions that we will take in the event that the significant disruption affects a single building a business district a citywide area or an entire region. We have different planned recovery times depending on the severity of the significant business disruption. In most of the scenarios addressed by our plan we anticipate recovery times within 24 hours from the significant business disruption. Even in the most significant business disruption scenario addressed by our plan we anticipate that critical business operations could be resumed within five days.To support our Business Continuity Plan recovery times we maintain a back-up facility including a secondary data center for all of our branches. Our back-up facility is located well away from our primary facilities so that it would not be affected by a regional disruption. Account access would be available through the data center at our back-up facility. Our plan will be reviewed updated and tested periodically. If a material change to the plan occurs this Notice of Business Continuity Preparedness will be updated as appropriate. We may modify this notice at any time with such modifications becoming effective upon posting to our web site.

 'text': [u'Toggle navigation Van Lanschot to sell portfolio of CRE loans to Cerberus Capital Management \u2019s-Hertogenbosch the Netherlands 6 August 2015 \u2013 Van Lanschot has signed an agreement with an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management LP on the sale of part of its portfolio of nonperforming commercial real estate loans. At a face value of over \u20ac 400 million this transaction will accelerate the runoff of the non-core corporate loan portfolio that started in 2013.Karl Guha Chairman of Van Lanschot\u2019s Executive Board: \u201cThis is a next step in the implementation of our wealth management strategy which focuses on activities contributing to the preservation and the creation of wealth for our private and institutional clients. Structured as a competitive bidding process the transaction allows us to benefit from market opportunities in this segment and we are pleased to have found an experienced and reliable party to manage the portfolio professionally.\u201dIn 2013 Van Lanschot announced its intention to halve the risk weighted assets of its corporate loan portfolio over a four-year period. The sale significantly reduces the risk profile of the corporate banking loan book and will have a positive impact on loan loss provisions going forward. As a result of this transaction the impaired ratio of the overall loan book of Van Lanschot (5.8% at YE 2014) reduces by more than 2.5 percentage points on a pro forma basis. The transaction is expected to result in a one-off charge of approximately \u20ac23 million (before tax) in the second half of 2015 and will have a marginally positive impact on Van Lanschot\u2019s core capital position.Following the transaction Van Lanschot will continue to run down the remaining portfolio (with an outstanding principal of \u20ac3.1 billion as per 31 December 2014) managed by its Corporate Bank.The transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2015.About Van LanschotVan Lanschot NV is the holding company of F. van Lanschot Bankiers NV the oldest independent bank in the Netherlands with a history dating back to 1737.

However we encourage the participation of selling shareholders and management teams in our investments. We believe that this participation creates strong alignment of incentives to drive improvement and growth in a business. In certain situations we will consider shared control or significant minority stakes.We invest in established operating companies in which it is possible to conduct fundamental investment analysis on reliable data in order to evaluate historical performance and future prospects. We seek to acquire companies with defensible market positions in fundamentally stable and sound markets. We value transparency and respect among all stakeholders in a transaction. The principals of A&M Capital Partners have over 85 years of combined experience executing private equity transactions in the middle-market. Our experience with various kinds of businesses and ownership profiles allows us to meet sellers' objectives with win-win transactions that specifically address the goals of existing shareholders. We are sensitive to the distractions that a sale process can cause and are therefore careful to prioritize efficiency and stability during our investigation and throughout our ownership. We are especially sensitive to protecting vital business interests such as relationships with customers employees and vendors.

At the time of its acquisition by Cerberus and a minority investor the business faced significant challenges: its industry was suffering from overcapacity and price competition; it was plagued by manufacturing and operational inefficiencies; it lacked a culture of performance and accountability; and because it was simply a part of a division of the parent company it had virtually no management team IT systems sales and marketing resources finance and accounting infrastructure regulatory and compliance processes or systems or other elements of the business functions necessary to run a complex highly regulated global business.After acquiring the company Cerberus moved quickly to install an experienced management team consisting of a number of COAC executives as well as new recruits. The team then implemented the operational improvement plan that Cerberus had developed during the due diligence process which involved strengthening the company by:Building standalone systems processes culture and organization and transitioning the business to independent statusImproving production quality reducing inventory write-downs by 75% while increasing manufacturing margins through improved processes yields and throughputRationalizing distribution building an international sales and marketing team and implementing pricing discipline across a range of productsInvesting more than $125 million into plant improvementsIntroducing new products and increasing R&D budgets to accelerate the development of new products and technologiesReinventing the supply chain by moving to a vertically integrated model which required an investment of $500 million to create a network of FDA-approved plasma collection centers and the hiring of about 3000 employeesCerberus\u2019s actions transformed the company into a leading provider of critical care treatments to patients with life threatening illnesses. During Cerberus\u2019s five-year stewardship the company was placed on a solid growth path that more than doubled its revenue and increased its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). The company also tripled its workforce to 5000 employees expanded product offerings built strong relationships with patient support organizations and launched a variety of charitable initiatives.After taking the company public in a successful initial public offering (IPO) in October 2009 Cerberus negotiated a strategic cash-and-stock merger of the company with a European competitor in June 2010. Strongly supported by the biotech company\u2019s public shareholders and analysts this $4 billion transaction merged companies with highly complementary geographic footprints synergistic manufacturing capabilities and distinct therapeutic products.Cerberus\u2019s achievements in the operational turnaround and creation of long-term value were widely recognized as was the firm\u2019s ability to consummate an IPO and then execute a sale to a well-matched strategic buyer at a time of global economic and financial uncertainty. \xa9 2015 Cerberus Capital Management']}

At the time of acquisition the company had $76 billion of managed assets in its portfolio of 2.7 million consumer loans and 900000 leases serviced.The lending company was severely challenged by the deep 2008 and 2009 recession and the near collapse of the U.S. auto industry that accompanied it.

The Firm underwrote a $195 million senior term loan $70 million of which was retained by Cerberus. Almost two years later the facility was amended to include an incremental $16.5 million advance and a release of $3.5 million of loan reserves to the borrower.With the benefit of Cerberus\u2019s financial and real estate experience the company in 2010 was able to reduce its facility revolver by 20% improving its liquidity position and placing the retailer in a position to manage its operations successfully. The loan was paid in full in early 2011. \xa9 2015 Cerberus Capital Management']}
